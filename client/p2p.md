# P2P Architecture
- The p2p architecture will be backed by ipfs, however another system will be required to request posts
- Anything a user posts, reblogs, and optionally likes will be made availiable from that users device to other devices in the network.
- Posts are stored on user devices, in addition to this storage, a database exists on the users device indicating: 
  - the public key of the author
  - the posts ipfs hash
  - the date of publication
