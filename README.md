# p2p-social : the social network powered by your phone

## Why ?

The recent changes on tumblr have only further highlighted the issues with centralised networks, despite this, federated networks have failed to progress, primarily due to people flooding to single instances instead of spreading out across instances. In adidtion to this the cost of operating social networks  is  enormous, but what if there was another way ?  Every day we carry around a powerful computer in our pockets, and at night, we plug it in to charge and it sits doing nothing. What if we could leverage these devices when they sit idle to operate a social network ? 

## What ?
A new, hybrid network, powered by p2p and coordinated by traditional servers, which has the advantages of a traditional network like tumblr without the excessive operating costs.

## How ?
This is what remains to be seen,  the goal of this whitepaper is to create a comprehensive vision of the network, with the technical details required to build it, where posisble, with existing technologies, it also aims to set out a structure of network stewardship to deal with issues such as moderation and the costs of operation.

## An invitation :
Thank you for taking the time to read this Introduction, The most important part of this project is your input : Everyone can contribute something, with no technical knowledge required. Ideas should be posted in the form of Github Issues during elaboration, once fully elaborated they can be properly written up and added to the whitepaper.
